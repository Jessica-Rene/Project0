Project0  [building Google Webpage]

Hello!  My name is Jessica Reyes!  I am from Wichita, KS, in the U.S.  Project0 was to recreate Google and make the functionality for ‘Google Search’ ‘I’m Feeling Lucky’ to work just like the original Google homepage.  The two different pages we had to recreate were ‘Advanced Search’ and ‘Image Search’ as if you were on Google Homepage.  
Using HTML to build the pages was a fun and challenging task.  The CSS ‘styling’ the pages was terrific to use to make the pages look as close to each other as I possibly could.
I also incorporated a little JavaScript for the ‘enter’ button.  I like pressing enter verses ‘buttons’ you click on to navigate a page.  So, it was fun to use that in code!
I got this to project to look as close to the original google search ‘homepage’ I possibly could!  Enjoy building code!  Thank you for watching!
